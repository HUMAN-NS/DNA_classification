Predict E.coli bacteria DNA promoter or non promoter
## Classifying DNA Sequences

Using Markov models, K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithms, support vector machines, and other common classifiers to classify short E. Coli DNA sequences. Use a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository that has 106 DNA sequences, with 57 sequential nucleotides (“base-pairs”) each.

1. Import data from the UCI repository
2. Convert text inputs to numerical data
3. Build and train classification algorithms
4. Compare and contrast classification algorithms
